This project is a web app to help lactose intolerant people in France to find easily the products that are suitable for their diet. To help them, we offer a barcode scanner, a search-bar and a historic/favorite mode to remember the products they already searched and liked.
It's a kind of Yuka but to find if there is lactose or not in the food products.
